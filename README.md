# Hej ðŸ™‚

I'm a student from southern Germany currently studying applied computer science! 

A short overview about some of my repositories:
- [SpookBot](https://github.com/Evolinox/SpookBot), a Discord Community Bot built with JDA (Java)
- [JS_TicTacToe](https://github.com/Evolinox/JS_TicTacToe), a Website where i learned the basics of HTML/CSS and JS
- some private stuff...

<!---
Spooki02/Spooki02 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
